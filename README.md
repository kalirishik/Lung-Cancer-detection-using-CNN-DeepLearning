 Implementing a lung cancer detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for early diagnosis and improved patient outcomes.
# Lung Cancer Detection using CNN

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a lung cancer detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system aims to assist in early diagnosis and improve patient outcomes by accurately identifying cancerous tissues in chest X-ray images.

## Key Features
- CNN-based model architecture for lung cancer detection
- Data preprocessing and augmentation techniques
- Model training and evaluation pipeline
- Deployment-ready code for real-world usage

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of chest X-ray images with annotations indicating the presence or absence of lung cancer. Due to privacy and regulatory considerations, the dataset is not included in this repository.
